  <h3>About us</h3><br>
  <p>
This cognitive ability testing
tool is aimed for both those who want to improve and upkeep their cognitive health
and abilities, as well as those who are already classified as being in cognitive decline.
Therefore, the best form of design in order to reach both demographics efficiently
would be to create a basic, simple and accessible application. The authors decided
that the easier the application is to navigate, then the easier it would be for the users
to use the tool and therefore get the most benefit out it in return.
Taking all of these factors into consideration, the design of this tool was created to
suit all types of users and of various cognitive health. The authors wanted this tool to 
be accessed by not only those of incredible cognitive function, but also those with
severely declining cognitive health.
